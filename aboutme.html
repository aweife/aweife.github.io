									<h2>Hi there.</h2>
									<p>My name is Ang Weifeng and I am 20 years old this year.</p>
									<p>Since young, I have always been playing games on my computer (something my parents did not like) and playing consoles at the expense of my relatives and friends since I'm not allowed to buy one. Most of my early childhood consisted of web browser games like Runescape, Adventure Quest, flash games at <a href="http://www.y8.com/">www.y8.com</a> and many other similar sites and games from facebook. I also enjoyed playing GTA and Monster Hunter on a PSP, as well as Halo on XBox. As I grew up, I moved on to F2P MMORPG such as Maplestory, Grand Chase, Dragon Nest, DotA 1 and League of Legends. As you can see, most of these games had two things in common: They were all multi-player and free-to-play.</p>
									<p>Yes, I did not know of many popular AAA-game titles until I've started studying in my course. I was confused when my course mates exclaimed things like, "What! You never heard of Assassin's Creed?" or "Man, how can you not played The Last of Us/Far Cry/Skyrim before?" I thought I had played many games where, in fact, I was swimming in a very small pond and there are oceans of games out there. This discovery of "new" games made me realised that the games industry had a lot of potential since there are definitely more oblivious people like me.</p> 
									<p>I am very happy to be able to develop my interest into passion by creating games and I aim to captivate the hearts of players all around the world and provide them with endless entertainment, which is just returning the favor.</p>
									<hr class="major">
									<h2>A little anecdote</h2>
									<p>I was on a bus when someone asked me this question:</p>
									<blockquote>So, what is game development all about? What is it you all really do?</blockquote>
									<p>To be honest, when the person asked this question, I was unprepared. A more professional answer would be along the lines of, "Well, first, the designer made a game design document of a game concept. Then the artists drew some concept art before moving on to 3D modeling and animations. The programmer then use a game engine and codes to compile everything into a working game". But that is a boring way to tell someone about game development and they may not even understand . Instead, I thought of a more interesting answer:</p>
									<div class="box">
									<p>Imagine a game is a beautiful picture and it is made up of many jigsaw puzzle pieces.</p>
									<p>A <i>designer</i> is someone who <b>designs</b> the story behind the picture, as well as the size and complexity of it. An <i>artist</i> then <b>create</b> each and every individual piece and lastly, a <i>programmer</i> will <b>assemble</b> the pieces into a finished jigsaw puzzle. Every role is equally important to ensure that what we end up making is a pretty picture that art collectors will buy.</p>
									<p>Without designers, what you will have is a messy and confusing picture. Without artists and you may have a blank jigsaw puzzle or a picture drawn by a five year-old. And without programmers, well, you will have some nice looking puzzle pieces.</p>
